    <h2 id ="biography">Biography</h2>
    <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,[7]
    the grandson of statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson 
    of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University 
    of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He 
    was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist, although in the book 
    Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named 
    equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize-winning
    chemist and half blanket-carrying cartoon character".</p>
